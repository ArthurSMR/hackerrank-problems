/*
 The is a car with a certain number of seats that only drives forward in a single road 1000km long.
 
 You are given the capacity of the car and an array of trips in which each trip has:
 - The number of passengers
 - The pick-up location
 - The drop-off location
 
 Example: given the trip [2,1,5], it means that 2 passengers will be picked up at 1st km and dropped off at 5th.
 
 Write a function that answers whether this car is able to comply with all the given trips.
 

 OUTPUTS EXAMPLES:
 
 [[2, 3, 6], [1,2,3]], 4 -> true
 [[2, 3, 6], [1,2,3]], 2 -> true
 [[2, 3, 6]], 2 -> false
 [[2, 3, 6]], 0 -> false
